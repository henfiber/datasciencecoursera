# Developing Data Products Project

Our proposed app is "Let me choose the K-Colors", a showcase of K-means with ColorBrewer Palettes.

This app showcases the benefits of interactivity in exploratory analysis. One may rapidly explore potential clusters in different dimensions with just a few clicks. Since we did not find any relevant example in the internet, we decided to illustrate also the selection of different color Palettes using RColorBrewer! Select the variables you want to plot in the X and Y-axis, which will be also the dimensions clustering will take place onto. The Color Palette widget allows you to select one of the qualitative ColorBrewer palettes. You may play around with the number of clusters and try to determine the optimal number.
